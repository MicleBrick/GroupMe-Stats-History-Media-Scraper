I know one of the great things about Ramadan is supposed to be the community but since my family isn't muslim I don't have that and last ramadan was the most alone I have really ever felt. Inshallah this year I'm going to try to break my fast more with others but it is still hard given my family so make dua for me. I'll make dua for you guys as well or help you out any way I can. </td>

One of ICPC's youth kids (14 years old) was walking home from school on Thursday when he was jumped by a group of kids, they picked him up and slammed him on his neck. He immediately started seizing and went into a coma (alhamdullah he woke up). He is in critical condition and he's in the ICU. Please keep him in your duas. The doctors said they can't even transfer him to the Hackensack hospital 10 minutes away for his surgery since the car ride there will be fatal. 
May Allah swt grant our brother shifa and a quick and speedy recovery

Eid Mubarak! May Allah accept our fasting and prayers this past month.

I hope you all had an amazing Eid yesterday. So I currently volunteer with Qabeelat Durbah (The New Jersey Chapter of Almaghrib Institute) and our upcoming seminar is with Shaykh Yasir Qadhi from July 28th to July 30th. The title of the class is "Collector's Edition: Sahih al-Bukhari. We usually have the seminar in Edison but this seminar is going to be held at NJIT in the atrium. 

I know Edison was a stretch for those living up north so this would be the perfect opportunity if you've never taken an Almaghrib class and wish to to take one or want to learn about Sahih al-Bukhari 

If you can't make it for the whole weekend you can make it to some of the seminar for the Free Friday. Qabeelat Durbah also offers financial aid for those who can't afford to pay for the whole seminar.  </td>

Then Allah commands a sacrifice of a yellow calf. And I realized like if you went by the value of the golden calf (ie how much can a solid gold calf, maybe weighing thousands of pounds of gold) purchase in live calfs, you could be talking about millions. Still Allah only demanded the sacrifice of ONE, which Israel only did reluctantly </td>

Israel is using the current situation in Jerusalem as a pretext to implement long-standing plans to divide Al Aqsa mosque like they did to the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron. This new move violates international law, restricts freedom of religion and violates the internationally agreed upon status quo of the Al Aqsa compound.

            <td>Salam guys, there is a bill Senate Resolution (S.720) and House Resolution (H.R. 1697) that threatens the constitutionally protected FIRST AMENDMENT right of free speech/political expression. 

The resolutions were written to criminalize the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement and to punish American businesses and peoples who choose to participate in the BDS movement, wherein individuals would potentially face a million dollar fine and up to 20 years in prison.

BDS is an effective form of protest against Israel. It began as a movement back in 05 to end Israeli occupation and force them to respect Palestinian rights. Since 05 Israel has lost billions of dollars because of BDS. We can't allow them to take away our rights like this. 

If your congressman is on this list call their office and use the talking points to let them know that you dont agree with this. Senator Menendez is state wide so you can call him no matter where you live in NJ #FreePalestine</td>

You always hear people saying "med school this" or "med school that" but do you ever take a second and ask yourself, what IS med school? Well, I did the heavy lifting here and figured it out for you. The "med" in med-school is actually an abbreviation for "medicine/medical" ��! So if you use the full word you'll actually be saying "medical school". SubhanAllah this is something that the companies do not want us to know! Please share this with your friends and family to educate them on the words they use every day without knowing their meaning! </td>

It is a subtle difference but in usooli language it makes a huge difference. This is because they categorize haram in two categories. One that is haram in it of itself and one that is not. The former is given a dispensation in matters of necessity (like eating pork so you don't die), while the latter is given a dispensation in matters of need (like student loans). Riba is explicitly haram. However, aakil ar-riba and mookil ar-riba are defined under the two categories I mentioned earlier. This why the dispensation was given to student loans. Now I know I'm treading a thin line. This absolutely does not automatically apply for the business loan. And the scholars are the ones who define hajja (need). Therefore, I would defer your question to a credible scholar @Amr Aly </td>

The schools don't teach anything about how loans work or taxes or how to pay off the loans. If they did most colleges would probably collapse because people would stop going, and a school like NJIT would be much harder to get into. So I hope the scholars are looking out for the kids and not just saying "college is a necessity, go to college and take debt if you need to", but rather look at the situation and help determine what the best path for the individuals are. And maybe the masjids as a whole. They can see where the needs are in that community. If there already 100 doctors maybe they need to encourage someone who's strong and can work with their hands to be a contractor, or maybe they don't have a good pipeline for scholars so people need to be encouraged towards that, etc </td>

With all that being said, the banking industry is one of the most corrupt industries in the world. I completely agree with you Tom that people need to be far more cautious rather than racking up loans haphazardly. I disagree with you in seeing it's the scholars job to be advising about that. I think individuals taking student loans need to seek consultation from professionals and experts in that respective field. At least until we have specialists in both fields (see the work the cilecenter is doing) </td>

I haven't run into them, usually it's people who regret doing so or never went to college that caution against it, who wouldn't necessarily be considered "experts". Or do you mean if I want to be a doctor to talk to a doctor about the pathways to becoming a doctor and potential payoff on loans? I could see that making sense. I agree that knowledge is emphasized but is there anything to distinguish "Islamic" knowledge from what we study in school? I was listening to a Hamza Yusuf lecture about that today. How if you study religion in a college setting, it's like "dissecting a dead animal", whereas if you study the traditional way you have the transmissions and the sheikh ensures you are in the right mindset and memorizing properly etc(tbh I don't know much of what true Islamic scholarship entails, so I'm generalizing)</td>

In Saheeh Muslim it was narrated from ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “There is no day on which Allaah frees more people from the Fire than the Day of ‘Arafaah. He comes close and expresses His pride to the angels, saying, ‘What do these people want?’”</td>

It's not hard to tell when a car is good and taken care of and with enough reading and learning you'll be okay, and when you finally decide on one just be safe and take it to a mechanic in the area, he'll check it out for you for no more than 40 bucks @Yazeed Bzadough </td>

But I wouldn't say it's "reliable" you're definitely taking a chance since the people selling on there often do it since they know a dealer won't give them much for their car. I also know of someone who bought a stolen car on there that had a fake title</td>

Usually you'll be able to tell even by the person that owned it how good the car is. And the 2-5k price range is different than looking for stuff under 1000.

However, let us also remember that none of us are protected from the harms of gossip and gheebah, no matter how pious.

So to conclude, none of us here should jump to claim that NAK is guilty; however, similarly, no one should call the accusatory parties liar and dismiss all they say because that is not our position and we are ignorant of the evidence both parties claim to present. What we should do is acknowledge that the faults of one scholar do NOT caste doubts on all scholars, and that our faith and commitment to Islam is not linked to any one preacher or scholar.  </td>

There's nothing wrong with respecting and admiring people of knowledge, but we have to realize that we are all human beings at the end of the day. Abu Bakr (RA) put it best after the Prophets death. "Whoever worshiped Mohammed, then Mohammed is dead. But whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is alive and shall never die." May Allah (swt) guide us all and keep us on the straight path and to never let our Iman waver.  And may He keep us away from gossip and spreading false information. </td>

Dr. Boger (dean of students) and Dr. Devan are trying to compile a list of all students  who have had a negative experience in any way with Mr. Jorjani. I know many of you guys had him for STS and other classes. At this point, if anyone has anything to report about this professor, please email Yasmine Elfarra ASAP at yhe22@njit.edu and she will forward your concerns to the administration. JAK</td>

By looking around and seeing if there are people negatively affected than they will know he's bringing those ideas into his classes. However if there are none then he's in the clear.

as some of you may know I’m currently running the MSA website and need to update it with some fresh content from our events and General Body members. If you’re interested, I’m looking for a couple articles for the MSA newsletter that we feature on the site.The articles can be about basically anything generally tied to the MSA or Muslims in the US. For those of you in honors this can actually count as community service hours if you still need some.

Please, keep this circulating.You walk across the parking lot, unlock your car and get inside. You start the engine and shift into reverse.  </td>

            <td>When you look into the rearview mirror to back out of your parking space, you notice a piece of paper stuck to the middle of the rear window. So, you shift into Park, unlock your doors, and jump out of your car to remove that paper (or whatever it is) that is obstructing your view.  When you reach the back of your car, that is when the carjackers appear out of nowhere, jump into your car and take off. They practically mow you down as they speed off in your car. And guess what, ladies? I bet your purse is still in the car! So now the carjacker has your car, your home address, your money, and your keys. Your home and your whole identity are now compromised! BEWARE OF THIS NEW SCHEME THAT IS NOW BEING USED.  If you see a piece of paper stuck to your back window, just drive away. Remove the paper later! And be thankful that you read this e-mail.  I hope you will forward this to friends and family, especially to women. </td>

Idk if u guys heard about the Tribeca Shooting in NY, but at least 8 people were killed and at least 12 people were injured. Now, i kno the numbers are fairly small compared to other things we’ve heard but the method of killing was utterly gruesome. Several people were struck head on by a home depot truck that was driving on the bicycle lane. The home depot truck then collided with a school bus i believe and then a shooting happened. To add insult to i jury, the news claim that the suspect’s truck had references to ISIS and and that hullabaloo. 
So hopefully keep those who died in your duas, and may Allah (swt) protect us, our friends and our families from harm. </td>

Right now I️ have 3 people on Senate helping me with the proposal but I️ would really appreciate MSA help since this does concern us. I️ would preferably like a few brothers and a few sisters to help with the initiative. Over the weekend I️ will be writing the actual proposal, but that is only the first step. We need more people to fill out the survey and we need help with a little bit more research to expand our list of schools that already have an MSA room. If you help it won’t be that much work. It will just involve helping to get more people to fill the survey out, it is basically just asking them to write their email/UCID on a google form). You will get all the ajr IsA and this is a great opportunity for sadaqah jariya for anyone who helps get this larger room. If you are interested in helping please like this message or email me at yhe22@njit.edu. The more people who help the better!Thank you! </td>

So I know this ain't really my thing but we got this volunteering thing coming up Nov. 22. Now we don't have really anyone who is willing to help except for like 2 people which is pretty embarassing in a group over 100.

I'm insisting, if you guys could come this Wednesday and really show that we do help out time to time, it would mean a lot. 

Partly because y'all pulled up and came in clutch, and partly it's because I asked and that's pretty G. I technically need 5 names, but we can do better. I'll also be part of this because you gotta practice what you preach. 

Nov. 22 is a Wednesday with a Friday schedule. 


I have high eggspectations from you guys, so don't let me down

This is for the Rise Against Hunger organization which is an international nonprofit hunger relief organization. We will be volunteering by helping to clean, organize and paint their warehouse on November 22nd, which is located in Kearny, NJ. We will meet at 11:30 AM and be back by around 2:30 PM, so about 3 hours in total. Because there will be painting involved, it's advised to dress accordingly. External volunteer hours will be provided.

I know I spam about a lot of things on this chat but this is something that is actually really important.

There is a 5 year old girl in my community (she went to Noble Leadership Academy, the Islamic School I went to) that has a rare and fatal brain cancer. She was only given a year to live 19 months ago. Her family is currently on a treatment plan that is extremely costly ($300,000) but has proven to be successful. She is just a child and any donation will be a huge help to the family. 

If any of you are willing to help, please go to https://www.youcaring.com/ayaazzawi-883163 and donate. And spread the word if you can. If not at least read her story because it really is amazing and will make you appreciate our lives and health that much more.</td>

Not only is this a 2 credit course that applies toward a student's diploma, but it also fulfills a Finance Elective requirement. Rutgers will be the very first public American university to offer an Islamic Finance class as part of their Finance curriculum. As many NJIT students are enrolled at Rutgers as well, you guys should consider taking this course. 

We are hosting an event next Wednesday December 6th at 6 PM entitled “Emerging Classes on Emerging Industries: an Intro to Islamic Finance" to promote this class as well as educate students about the Islamic Finance industry. A high turn-out rate for this class will assist us in our ultimate goal of launching a full minor in Islamic Finance at Rutgers. Come through and spread the word please!</td>

So the motto of the crusaders, and is used in some “alt right” circles today is “Deus Vult”, Latin for God wills it. Meanwhile Muslims say “inshAllah”, “if Allah wills”. I think this is very important because Muslims accept the will of Allah and try to see the best in every situation as being a blessing from Allah, whereas Christians and some others will try to say they know what the will of Allah is, very pretentious and not something any human can know! Let me know if you have any thoughts or deeper insights on this</td>

And the Harvard piece about Elena Kagan really made me think. You have as he said 50% of the Harvard law school run by Zionists Jews and the other 50% I’m sure are Zionist sympathizers. I think the video was a few years old, but last year Harvard had a “blacks only” graduation. Colleges and the media and government are spewing destructive liberalism like this, not to mention transgenderism and removal of God/morals from society. So basically they take control, and then divide and weaken us with these destructive ideas. So instead of looking into the ideas David Duke presented, we focus on issues that are virtually irrelevant in comparison, and anyone who speaks out about it is labeled and anti Semitic and racist(even though Arabs are also Semitic lol).

I told the guy interviewing me I had to pray, but he said he had another meeting and I couldn’t stay without a chaperone since I am a guest. So I went outside and looked for the nearest halal food cart. Alhamdulillah the guy let me pray and honestly it was a very humbling experience and he will get the reward for letting me use his rug, and I made dua that Allah will bring him success in this life and the afterlife.

On February 6th, my case against the NYPD will go to the highest appeals court in New York State.  As you guys are aware, this case started as a result of government surveillance on Muslim Student Associations throughout the Tri-State area. I requested files on myself because I was a Rutgers Newark MSA member. I was given a “we can neither confirm nor deny” response.  I am asking everyone here to show up for support.</td>

After 14 years of service, I never asked for anything in return.  If you are in this chat there is a good chance that I was your Sunday school teacher, your ICPC mentor, your fan in MYCC, and even your friend. But most importantly, I am your Muslim brother.  There will always be another class to attend and another day to go work but this is your only chance to show support for this case. I will be in court at 2pm, at the court of appeals in Albany, New York. The address is 20 eagles street, Albany, New York.  I hope you all can help. </td>

After reading into this case for the past few days, I can confidently say that this story is nothing short of courageous and inspiring. Countless hours and days have been given to fight the NYPD’s wrongful surveillance, which is a clear violation of both the First and Fourth Amendments of the US Constitution, by our Muslim brothers and sisters to stand up for all of OUR rights as Muslim Americans. Too often, we become upset and complain about injustice, however, we rarely do anything as a community to actually take action. The least we can do is show support for the Muslim brothers and sisters who are fighting this battle on behalf of all of us. Inshallah I’ll do everything I can to be there.

As you guys know we’ve been preparing for Halallywood and we need to start thinking about the decorations for the day of.

The responsibilities will include talking in the chat and coming up with ideas for decoration, helping setup the day of, help painting the mural and meeting a couple times in necessary."</td>

 Why Islam is starting couple of new programs.  Why Islam wants to have SAT classes for unprivileged students especially in lower income communities such as Newark, Elizabeth....
They need 6-7 young dedicated volunteers who can spare 1-1/2 hour each week to have these classes.  Plz spread the word if anyone interested in helping.  Why Islam will arrange everything such as flyers, marketing, student setup.. all they need is volunteer teachers.

 � The Intention ! 

A teacher of mine once told me that he and a few others sat with their Shaykh in Yemen within his house, when someone knocked on the door. My teacher said, “I got up to open the door but the Shaykh stopped me and said, ‘What are you doing?’ I said, ‘I’m going to open the door’ He replied, ‘Is that it?’ I said, ‘Yes’ He said, ‘In that case, let me open the door instead’ which he did. 
When he came back to the study circle, the Shaykh said, ‘Your intention was to just open the door, that’s why I told you to sit down. As for me, I intended to (1) walk towards the assistance of my brother, (2) to apply the Sunnah of smiling at him, (3) to apply the Sunnah of the Islamic greeting, (4) to apply the Sunnah of handshaking, (5) to make a space for him next to me, (6) to apply the Sunnah of honouring the guest…..” and he continued listing his intentions till he’d mentioned around forty!”</td>

“I sleep and then wake up to pray at night, and so I expect Allah to reward me for my sleep just as I expect Him to reward me for my prayer.” 
(Al-Bukhari)

He made sure that he added a intention for his sleep – to regain strength for worship – and thus Mu’aadh anticipated reward for every second of his sleep.
Perhaps after the above, you and I will never see the famous prophetic statement in the same way again, when he said: 

إنّمَا الأَعْمَالُ بالنِّيّاتِ، وَإِنَّمَا لِكُلِّ امرِىءٍ مَا نَوَى

“Actions are by intentions, and each person shall be rewarded according to his intention”
