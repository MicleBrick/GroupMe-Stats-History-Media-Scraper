I saw this off the Facebook page, and believe it to be a good oppertunity to obtain a few Qurans for the Salah room. 
I had intentions of presenting this idea after the summer, but I don't want to pass on this generous offer. 
What does everyone think; should I make arrangements?

It can be helpful to choose a bad habit we want to eliminate in our lives and a good habit we want to develop. Given that Ramadan is the month of the Quran, it might also be helpful to set Quranic goals. Perhaps we want to read the entire Quran once this Ramadan (20 pages a day). Let's also not forget to dedicate some time to understanding the Quran as well, being sure to dedicate time daily to reading translation or listening to an easy tafseer (Nouman Ali Khan has some on YouTube and on the Podcast app on iPhone, under the Bayyinah Channel). Let's also not forget to give some time to memorizing Quran, no matter how small the amount (even a line a day), or reviewing what we've previously memorized. </td>

It's a month that shows us the fruits that come with struggle, for the sake of Allah SWT. We need to push ourselves this month InshaAllah, we have a huge opportunity ahead of us. Let's limit the time we spend on social media, TV, shows, etc. Let's make a sincere intention to benefit from this Ramadan and grow in our Iman  </td>

Allah SWT loves that which is less but consistent. So let's be ambitious, but realistic. And let's ask Allah SWT to give us strength and consistency. May Allah SWT make us all from those who truly benefit from this Ramadan. May He SWT allow us to exit it having changed ourselves for the better and having grown in our Islam and our Iman.

Eid Mubarak! May Allah accept our fasting and prayers this past month.

I hope you all had an amazing Eid yesterday. So I currently volunteer with Qabeelat Durbah (The New Jersey Chapter of Almaghrib Institute) and our upcoming seminar is with Shaykh Yasir Qadhi from July 28th to July 30th. The title of the class is "Collector's Edition: Sahih al-Bukhari. We usually have the seminar in Edison but this seminar is going to be held at NJIT in the atrium. 

I know Edison was a stretch for those living up north so this would be the perfect opportunity if you've never taken an Almaghrib class and wish to to take one or want to learn about Sahih al-Bukhari 

If you can't make it for the whole weekend you can make it to some of the seminar for the Free Friday. Qabeelat Durbah also offers financial aid for those who can't afford to pay for the whole seminar.  </td>

This will be a bit off the rails from our ongoing discussion at the moment, but I wanted to send this message early to give ample time for responses before the semester begins. As many of you know, one of the responsibilities of the Academic Director is to run the tutoring service that the MSA provides for its members. Ahead from managing it though, much of the contribution usually ends up being led by the Shura and General Body as a whole. This past year, however, we had a low number of tutors, and were unfortunately unable to continue the program. One of my goals for Fall is to start over fresh, and again provide this as a service. To do this though, we’re going to need tutors, and I’d hope that some of you would volunteer Inshallah.</td>

I told him that we're extremely tight on budget and that that's still too high for us, but he told me that we can easily find an organization to sponsor us and he started mentioning a few. So I told him that if he knows of an organization that would be 100% willing then that should work but of course i'd have to discuss it with the rest of the eboard before giving him a final decision. So he mentioned that his close friend is a ceo of an organization who can easily sponsor at least $1000 and we'd have to cover the remaining $500 + travel, hotel, and meal accommodations, and he'd speak to the organization on our behalf. Sh. Kamal is available on November 9th for the time being. Please let me know if we want to move forward with this or not insA so I can let him know. </td>

So I looked into the cotton candy machines on Amazon and the cheapest thing I found that wasn’t the size of a cereal bowl was $160. I found 3 others that were $200 or less so I’ll share them all here. 
Based on reviews and pricing, I’ll send the links in order from what I think is best - (sorry in advance for sending 10 messages in a row)</td>

So MSA is in good standing with the Senate in records to renting things and being active in general. So we ARE recognized by senate. However they apparently sent out an email to us to submit our line-budget and we did not respond to that email and submit our budget for this semester. Therefore, we cannot get any funding from the senate for just this semester. 

@Lellas Alhallak Whenever you can can you please search the email ss-vpf@njit.edu and let me know when the email about submitting the line budget was sent</td>

However we were never able to meet and when we reached the deadline I filled it out however I could and emailed it to them. After speaking to Mansi asking if we could be forgiven for going over the deadline she declined us. So technically it's my fault, I should've just filled it out and not waited to discuss it, but alhamdulillah</td>

So they requested petty cash for it instead and she they spent $350 for food and got reimbursed the next day for it. Now this might only apply to clubs who submitted a line budget but it’s worth a shot to find out?

Also, we’ve always been in good standing with senate and we always surpass their 2 events per semester requirement so I think it’s worth a shot to try and work on some kind of compromise with them. If they don’t want to give us a real budget, the petty cash program can really help us out. Sorry for the super long message but, thoughts? </td>

As people RSVP through paperless post I’ll update it on the doc (highlighted cells mean they’ve responded) so if you contact anyone and they RSVP to you, make sure you update it on the doc so we can keep track of everything & be organized. I don’t think we should be individually contacting anyone yet so let’s give it a week or so and then we can start inshaAllah. I’ll update the “opened evite” column as well so if you contact someone who hasn’t opened their evite, please confirm their preferred email address so we can update the database and let me know so I can update it on paperless post as well. Also if anyone isn’t on the list, feel free to add them but please let me know so I can be sure to send them an invite through email. </td>

I forgot to mention a couple things in the meeting.

1. Someone named Adel Soliman passed by the msa room and said that there will be a SAC art showcase Tues.10/17. He will be supplying the henna, but he is looking for someone to do it if possible. 

2. The law survey sent out in last weeks email got 2 responses. So what should we tell the people that responded? 

3. Someone emailed saying he is interested is supplying Arabic themed personalized hoodies and t-shirts to our community. He wants us to share images and prices he sent to gauge the level of interest.

So I contacted Juicy Platters and this is what the manager told me 
Their largest package is for 36 people and is $256.80. That includes our choice of meat, sauteed onions, rice, salad, pita bread and 3 bottles of sauce.
I explained to her that we’ve used them for catering multiple times and asked if we can get a discount and she said 3 packages are enough for 108 people and it would be $770.40, but she can give us a 5% discount so it would be $730.</td>

And we hear time and time again how we should love each other for the sake of Allah SWT and how none of us is a believer until we love for our brothers and sisters what we want for ourselves. And I think a major problem in academics especially college is severe competitiveness between each other where people sadly don't get happy at the success of their friends and sometimes even wish for them to do badly because they think it will impact their own success. So I think one of the topics should be about truly embodying what it means to love our brothers and sisters and that we should sincerely pray for their success and happiness. </td>

So if Zaid Abbassi chooses to talk about the loving, that could be the topic. Idk on the flyer what the actual name for the topic would be though. </td>

So we don't turn to Allah only for mercy or forgiveness or whatever it is, but for everything in our lives.

Jamal told us that he can either make Uzi with lamb, salad, and a tray of hummus or a mixed grill of kufta and chicken kebabs with rice and salad. 

I know this is a pretty large amount of money for one event so I’m thinking we should go with our cheapest option and save Darna for the Alumni Dinner.

Salam everyone, 
as some of you may know I’m currently running the MSA website and need to update it with some fresh content from our events and General Body members. If you’re interested, I’m looking for a couple articles for the MSA newsletter that we feature on the site.The articles can be about basically anything generally tied to the MSA or Muslims in the US. For those of you in honors this can actually count as community service hours if you still need some.

It’d still be $5 a person for the platter but he said he’d be willing to throw in a couple extra for us for free for both events. So if we were to get 120 platter for the Rutgers event it would be a total of $600 and it should already be packaged for us so we won’t have to do much work. And Rutgers is willing to chip in $100 so I’m not sure if we still want to go to go with them. He told me to just call him on Wednesday to let him know how many we’ll need and </td>

I looked into having it already made for us from Shoprite or Acme and they turned out wayyy too expensive ($40 for 10-12 servings).

For Aisha's, he said for 90 people the cheapest option is 529 for 5 large trays (1 tray feeds 20 ppl) of chicken and broccoli. We can do the same thing for sesame chicken but that would be an upcharge to 600. Both options come with rice. He said the manager would be willing to work on lowering the price for us since we're a Muslim organization, but he wants us to finalize and decide on what we want first before he talks to her. 

For Sahara, the normal price for a shawarma sandwich is 6.50, but she'll give us each sandwich to us for 4.50. She said this is their very large and filling sandwich (which is why we originally considered Sahara.) We can decide on how many sandwiches we would want, but 100 sandwiches would be 450 dollars, and she said she won't change us taxes or any other fees. </td>

We can’t just pour in ready made coffee, the  heaters are actually just giant coffee makers. So we have to put in the grinds and water ~35 mins before we expect to use them. I know it’s a little bit more work but at least we can guarantee fresh tasting coffee. 

What do you guys think?

They cost within $20 need grinds, a filter, and water and can also be used in the future for smaller events such as gbms. That way we have one machine with 40 cups ready (or 80 if we have two heaters) and we can continuously make more at a fast pace.

So I was planning for the scheduling and this is what I think is best for tomorrow: anyone who comes to the table and asks a question/brings up a concern about the religion gets cotton candy using the machine that we just bought. Also, to incorporate Yasmine's  idea, we can have a chalk board/marker board up that people can write one thing they think of or admire about the religion. Anyone who does this can also get the cotton candy. Thoughts? 

We said during the meeting that we'd use jolly ranchers since the machine can incorporate it into the cotton candy.@Aya Ghazy were you able to get it from Costco or wherever else you went? </td>

Do you guys think it would be effective if we sent an email out everyday about the next days events? Like send today’s email about tomorrow’s table & Zaied Abbassi’s talk, then tomorrow send an email about Tuesday’s table & Dr. Islam’s talk, etc? I know it might get annoying but on the other hand, a lot of people I spoke to didn’t know that IAW is this week & didn’t know what speakers we had for what days etc. so I don’t know, what do you guys think? </td>

Currently we are in very good standing; however, that standing is diminishing as time passes (dramatic, but true lol) meaning the longer it takes to submit the proposal the less of a chance we have in getting it. So please take time, do some research, and fill out 1 school. Additionally, I need help increasing the responses on the form. I need min 350 responses. this means even if you know a muslim who is not in anyway associated with the MSA, still reach out to them and have them fill out the form. Maybe it'll be awkward but who cares, because we need more responses.</td>

Can one of the sisters please make sure all the hijabs are available and ready by the 12 o'clock start time isA?  In case heather goes tomorrow at 10 and they can't give us the machine, I think maybe we should have a back up just in case. Maybe just cotton candy again if worse comes to worse. I really like the Quran idea, we just need a pair of headphones if anyone can bring a pair they don't really care about tomorrow. Finally, @Aya Ghazy you said you got more than one poster so we don't have to buy another one for the guys to write their thoughts after the Quran right? We'll also just buy the bags of popcorn from SAC for convenience's sake. </td>

So far we want to have Quran Night & Project Ummah so we have to pick dates & rooms for those. We can also consider having one more brothers/sisters event or one big game night to end the semester. We can also consider having an AMA so we ca host Dr. Islam since he couldn’t make it this week, or we can keep that for next semester. So please think about what events you think we should have and just send in your thoughts throughout the day so we can have everything finalized by tonight inshaAllah. Keep in mind that Dec 13 is the last day of classes and Dec 15 is the first day of finals</td>

Right now I️ have 3 people on Senate helping me with the proposal but I️ would really appreciate MSA help since this does concern us. I️ would preferably like a few brothers and a few sisters to help with the initiative. Over the weekend I️ will be writing the actual proposal, but that is only the first step. We need more people to fill out the survey and we need help with a little bit more research to expand our list of schools that already have an MSA room. If you help it won’t be that much work. It will just involve helping to get more people to fill the survey out, it is basically just asking them to write their email/UCID on a google form). You will get all the ajr IsA and this is a great opportunity for sadaqah jariya for anyone who helps get this larger room. If you are interested in helping please like this message or email me at yhe22@njit.edu. The more people who help the better!Thank you! </td>

Here’s another idea: what if we keep the Salah event on the 29th and if we can’t book a room for Dec 7, we can just have separate guys/girls events since we only had one of those this semester. We can dedicate time during those events to get feedback from people and we can even go more in depth with it during our last gen body meeting (even though people haven’t really been coming but still).

We don’t have a speaker booked yet and we can’t advertise for it until we do & we’re already behind on advertising. 2. Since we’re running short on time, it might come off as a little forced and it might kill the momentum we built for & after IAW. 3. If we cancel, we can save up for awesome events for next semester! We can always plan for a really good event focused around Salah for next semester- we definitely have the potential of pulling off an awesome workshop. What do you guys think? </td>

Lets have a girl’s event (movie night) on the 29th, move Quran night to the 7th, project ummah on the 14th and just cancel the 12th. 

Reason for moving Quran night to the 7th instead of 12th would be because its too close to finals and project ummah. Also, I think having another game night is really repetitive. We’ve had more game nights than lectures lol

Team dodgeball is pretty self explanatory, but I can explain the rules more later if necessary

Kappadi is a game where there's an imaginary line dividing two teams and one guy from team A has to go and tag as many people as he can from team B and come back all while saying the word "kappadi"

If he stops saying it on the other side because he runs out of breath or because the other team has grabbed him and restrained him, he's out. </td>

I know I'm a bit late to this, but I've been slightly preoccupied this weekend. 
Admittingly, I don't know Baker as well as many of the others here, but from what I've seen he has a large knowledge pool, and an immense amount of experience dealing with issues that effect Muslims our age today. And while I'm a sucker for Day of Judgement halaqas like anyone else, I believe that we should really take advantage of the time he's offering and find a topic that would make integrating practical issues into his talks much easier. </td>

As all of you have noticed I’ve been MIA for some time now. I’ve had a really stacked schedule recently and my Spring semester won’t be any better unfortunately. 
Insha Allah I’ll be doing my PR work-finding khateebs and speakers-but won’t be able to attend most meetings and events. 
I just wanted to put this out there as we are a team and deserve to be on the same page. If there’s anything I can help with please tag me and let me know.

1. For the RU Collaboration, did we decide for sure on having it be an inter-MSA dinner/Workshop? I didn't know what to call it.
2. For the "End of Year Banquet”, we were calling it “End of Year Banquet” on the minutes but it’s not really the end of the year so I wrote it as “End of Semester Banquet” even tho that doesn’t sound as nice lol Also did we say this was going to be the volunteer appreciation dinner or are we having a separate event for that?
3. We didn’t name a date for Quran Night so it’s not on the card—I can put it in and put TBA for time and place?
4. For the class with Baker, I didn’t include a room since we don’t know yet. Should I just not put it in?</td>

As you guys know we’ve been preparing for Halallywood and we need to start thinking about the decorations for the day of. So as many of you know, the theme is YouTube and I need a group of people to start planning and brainstorming ideas for decorations. Like this message if you would like to be part of the decorations committee for Halallywood. The responsibilities will include talking in the chat and coming up with ideas for decoration, helping setup the day of, help painting the mural and meeting a couple times in necessary. </td>

The function of the MSA is more so strengthening the Muslim community here and bringing awareness. Having a Jesus table with pamphlets during Easter  doesn’t seem very productive to me and it’s def not worth the risk of bringing in an already controversial organization </td>

Please do not disclose this information to anyone. Perhaps I wasn't explicit enough yesterday, or perhaps it was misinterpreted during the premature excitement, but these numbers are not indicative of victory. Allah will choose whomsoever he pleases, and his judgement is not constrained by the calculations of man. 
The competition is over, so have patience till the 15th and make dua that Allah will accept.
If anyone asks, let them know that it was close, and that we don't know the final outcome. Inshallah, you will find that to be closest to the truth. </td>

1. Guess the Ben & Jerry’s flavor of ice cream (we can just pick up like 3 or 4 flavors from the subway by njit) and then we give out regular ice cream because Ben & Jerry’s is expensive 
2. What’s in my hand challenge and we give out cotton candy 
3. The baby food challenge and we give out jello cups 

What day would you guys want to do which? We have tables for Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. It might snow on Thursday though so I don’t think we should do the ice cream that day </td>

Pushing elections back a week puts next shura in difficult situation. 
Participating in the carnival and holding elections same day (4/11) means participating either 11-2 or 4-6, since elections would be 2:30-4. Making elections a week earlier means we'll give less time for responses to the nomination/acceptance/bio emails.

And even that will be rushed as the planning meeting designated for that will likely be a day before our banquet.</td>
